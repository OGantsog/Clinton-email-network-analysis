# Clinton email network analysis

Network analysis using R and RStudio on the Kaggle dataset under the name "Hillary Clinton's Emails". Networks analysis on emails is also invigorated by Topic modelling using Python Jupyter notebook.

Libraries jsonlite, dplyr, igraph, ggnetwork, intergraph, ggrepel are used. Vertices are email accounts and there is an edge if there is an email sent from one to the other. Analysis is made on both of directed/undirected and simple/weighted graphs from this data.

Simple features such as degree, path length, betweenness, closeness and transitivity are analyzed. Also cliques and communities are detected in the network.
